---

A participatory framework is a set of principles and guidelines that are used to design and implement programs and initiatives that involve active participation to the decision-making process from members of a community.    
A participatory framework is often used in the context of community development, where it is intended to promote collaboration and inclusiveness, and to ensure that the needs and interests of all members of the community are considered and addressed. 

A participatory framework typically includes elements such as community involvement, dialogue and communication, and the sharing of resources and decision-making power. Overall, a participatory framework is intended to create more equitable and sustainable communities by fostering collaboration and participation among all members.
