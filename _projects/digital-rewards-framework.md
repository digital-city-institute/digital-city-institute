This project explore the use of digital rewards to incentivize and motivate positive behaviors in modern communities.
The digital rewards framework will be designed to support a wide range of applications and services, including communication and information sharing, community engagement, and online commerce. 

The goal of this project is to create a flexible and scalable system that can be used by communities of all sizes to encourage collaboration and participation. 

We are seeking researchers and developers with expertise in social networking, game design, and behavioral psychology to join our team and help make this vision a reality.
