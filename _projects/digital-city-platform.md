**IM.CITY** - The Digital City Platform built on top of the [CityOS] operating system.    
The platform is in the proof-of-concept stage and is currently exploring and testing various directions, such as a rewarding system, digital organizations, city spaces, checkin interactions, and universal basic income (ubi) distribution, in order to determine their feasibility and potential benefits.
