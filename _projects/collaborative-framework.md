A collaborative framework is a set of guidelines or principles that are designed to facilitate collaboration among individuals or organizations.      
It provides a structure and a common language for people to work together, and can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. 


Collaborative frameworks can be applied to a wide range of situations, from small teams working on a specific project to large-scale initiatives involving multiple organizations. Some examples of collaborative frameworks include agile methodology, Design Thinking, and Lean Startup. These frameworks provide tools and techniques for team members to work together effectively and efficiently, and can help to improve communication, collaboration, and problem-solving within the group.
