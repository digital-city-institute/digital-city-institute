# The Academic Supervisory Board

is a group of academics who provide oversight and guidance for the institute's conceptual work and research planning. They ensure that the institute's activity adheres to ethical and professional standards, and provide support for researchers as they develop and plan their studies. The board also helps to facilitate collaboration and coordination among different conceptualization and standardization groups.
