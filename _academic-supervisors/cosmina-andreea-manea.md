As a researcher of urban environments and a geography teacher, Cosmina has direct fieldwork experience in European urbanism and architecture. She has a double degree in both Geography and Economy, with a master degree in Intelligent Territorial Development.
For her PhD research, she focuses on urban-rural interfaces dynamic and governance. Also, she has experience in urban planning consultancy as part of European funded projects and created the urban co-creation decision-making project Urbring. Her passion for geography and territorial planning began since high-school, when she participated at two editions of the International Geography Olympiad, winning the gold medal on each of them.
