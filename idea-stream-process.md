The process of identifying problems, research and solutions for future contexts requires a systematic and analytical approach that involves understanding the context, identifying and analyzing the problem, generating and evaluating potential solutions, and implementing and monitoring the chosen solution.      

This process of problem-solution proposals within the Digital City Institute, as a think tank, will make use of the tools developed within the CityOS.dev Framework for community participation and will consist in the following steps: 


1. Context Proposal
2. Problem Identification
2. Research
3. Solution Proposal
4. Solution Evaluation
